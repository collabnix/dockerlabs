# What is Docker Container?


A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and 
reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of 
software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers - images become containers 
when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same, 
regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences 
for instance between development and staging.

Docker containers that run on Docker Engine:

-  Standard: Docker created the industry standard for containers, so they could be portable anywhere
-  Lightweight: Containers share the machine’s OS system kernel and therefore do not require an OS per application, driving higher server efficiencies and reducing server and licensing costs
-  Secure: Applications are safer in containers and Docker provides the strongest default isolation capabilities in the industry
