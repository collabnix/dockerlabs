## Introduction to Dockerfile


- Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. 
- A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.  
- Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.
