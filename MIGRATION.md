## 📚 Lab Structure

Each lab is now structured as a TypeScript object with the following format:

```typescript
interface Lab {
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  title: string;                 // Lab title
  description: string;           // Brief description
  category: string;              // beginners/intermediate/advanced
  difficulty: 1-5;               // Difficulty rating
  duration: string;              // Estimated time
  prerequisites?: string[];      // Required knowledge
  tags: string[];               // Search tags
  sections: LabSection[];        // Content sections
  nextLab?: string;             // Navigation
  previousLab?: string;         // Navigation
}
```

### Content Section Types
- **text**: Regular content with markdown support
- **code**: Syntax-highlighted code blocks
