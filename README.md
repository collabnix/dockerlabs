## Building Docker Swarm Cluster & Visualization

To get started with Docker Swarm, you can use Play with Docker, shortly called PWD. It's free for all to test drive 5 Node Swarm Cluster. Follow the below steps in case you are looking out for setting up Docker Swarm for $0 with Fancy visualizer.

- Open https://labs.play-with-docker.com on your browser
- Click on Icon near to Instance to choose 3 Managers & 2 Worker Nodes

- Wait for few seconds to bring up 5-Node Swarm Cluster



## Time to build Swarm Cluster Visualizer tool 

Swarm Visualizer is a fancy tool which visualized the Swarm Cluster setup. It displays containers running on each node.

## Clone the Repository
